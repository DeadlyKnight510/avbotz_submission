The differences between Pipes and Shared Memory!

If the programs all talk to each other without a central form of communication, I would choose Shared Memory.


Shared Memory is better when many programs need to send information to each other like in this case. 2 or more programs share memory and communicate using that memory. This saves resources as one central area is used, instead of many files. 

Though it is more useful in our situation, it is harder to debug. This is important because there will definitely be some error when we are getting it to work. 


Advantages
1. Better between many programs
2. 2 or more programs share memory to communicate
3. saves resources
4. Easy to check for updates once in a while (not good for quickly transmitting info)

Disadvantages
1. Harder to Debug and make sure it works
2. have to know when data has been changed / added
3. more work




Pipes
Advantages
1. simple to use
2. thread safe function (mkfifo)
3. OS handles more

Pipes are easier to work with, as it is a direct form of communication between two programs.
